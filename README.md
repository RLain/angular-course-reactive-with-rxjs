# Stateless Observables Service


## Traditional imperative style

To understand how reactive design works, we first need to understand how the traditional imperative style works.

"In programming, imperative style is a paradigm where code explicitly describes how to achieve a specific result through a sequence of instructions or commands. This is in contrast to declarative style, which focuses on describing what the desired result is, leaving the "how" to the underlying system."

"Imperative code provides clear, sequential instructions, making it:
â€¢ Easier to follow for simple tasks.
â€¢ Well-suited for scenarios where step-by-step control is essential.

However, it can become verbose and harder to maintain as complexity increases, particularly in asynchronous or reactive programming contexts like Angular."

To kick off the understanding, we start by using the httpClient (Observable based service) to hit our backend.

```ts
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {

  beginnerCourses: Course[];

  advancedCourses: Course[];


  constructor(private http: HttpClient, private dialog: MatDialog) {

  }

  ngOnInit() {

    this.http.get('/api/courses')
      .subscribe(
        res => {

          const courses: Course[] = res["payload"].sort(sortCoursesBySeqNo);

          this.beginnerCourses = courses.filter(course => course.category == "BEGINNER");

          this.advancedCourses = courses.filter(course => course.category == "ADVANCED");

        });

  }
```

### proxy.json

Small side note: package.json script "start": "ng serve  --proxy-config ./proxy.json" leverages off the proxy.json file e.g.

```json
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:9000",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

Meaning when we hit the HTTP Client uses /api, it leverages off the defined target in proxy mode ergo invokes localhost:9000.

```ts
this.http.get('/api/courses').subscribe(..etc)
```

### Oberserable

The following creates an observable, which allows us to observe the behaviour:

```ts
 ngOnInit() {
    this.http.get('/api/courses')
      .subscribe(
        res => {
          const courses: Course[] = res["payload"].sort(sortCoursesBySeqNo);

          this.beginnerCourses = courses.filter(course => course.category == "BEGINNER");

          this.advancedCourses = courses.filter(course => course.category == "ADVANCED");

        });

  }
```

An observable may emit many values over its lifetime, it also may emit none. We can receive the events emitted by the observable via the callback aka `rest => {}` which responds to any emissions. 

The properties this.beginnerCourses and this.advancedCourses are directly assigned the filtered arrays. This direct manipulation of state reflects a typical imperative approach.

#### Refactoring

The first potential issue raised with the imperative style is the potential for [Callback hell](https://callbackhell.com/).

There is also too much logic inside the component. The component knows that data is coming from the backend, it also knows how to do the HTTP call and process the data it receives.

Ideally a component shouldn't know where the data is coming from. And also it should be easy to test the component in isolation without having to use a real HTTP backend. 

Another thing is that keeping data in the following immutable properties is problematic as if there is any change in the data locally in the component, there is no way for the application to know the data has been modified:

```ts
beginnerCourses: Course[];
advancedCourses: Course[];
```

Ideally, code should be flat.
